# Functional programming

According [Wikipedia][1]:

[1]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming>

> In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. It is a declarative programming paradigm in which function definitions are trees of expressions that map values to other values, rather than a sequence of imperative statements which update the running state of the program.

> In functional programming, functions are treated as first-class citizens, meaning that they can be bound to names (including local identifiers), passed as arguments, and returned from other functions, just as any other data type can. This allows programs to be written in a declarative and composable style, where small functions are combined in a modular manner.

## The most important definitions to understand in functional programming:
 - Pure functions
 - Function composition
 - Shared state
 - Immutability
 - Side effects
